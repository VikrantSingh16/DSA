It is tree with rules applied to It
Each node can only have 0,1,2 child nodes
Each child can only have one friend

Terminologies
1. Perfect Binary Tree : A tree is complete filled that means all the leaf node are full
a node can either have 0 or 2 children but cannot have 1 child 
Perfect Binary are really efficient 
2 properties
1. The number of nodes double when we move to lower levels (2xnode(Uper Level))
2. The number of node on the last node is equal on the sum of number of nodes on each level + 1 (all Nodes+1)

2. Full Binary Tree : A node can either have 0 or 2 childrens

height of the tree = 2^height-1

Binary Search Tree Time Complexity
insert: O(logn)
delete: O(logn)
lookup: O(logn)

Rules for BST:
1. All child node in the tree on the right to the root is greater than current node
2. All child node in the left on the left to the root is lesser than current node
3. A node can only have upto 2 nodes


Problems with UnBalanced Tress : time Complexity can be decreased to O(n)

Pros of BST
1. faster than O(n)
2. Dynamic
3, Ordered

cons of BST
1. No O(1) operations
